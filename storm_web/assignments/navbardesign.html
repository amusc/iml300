	<h3> navigation bar design process </h3>
	
	For my navigation bar, I wanted to create something that would be minimal and feature multiple colors. I utilized my signature color and then a hue that was close to it to break up the space on the page. I did this with a bar that runs horizontally under the title. I also wanted the styling of both the color and the shape of navbar links to change when selected. When hovered over, a yellow rectangle is shown. Horizontal navbars seem to be more standard, but I created a vertical one that will be easily scaleable if there are more items to add to my menu. I feel that this layout works better for the negative space I created, as well as my aforementioned design elements, than they would horizontally.
