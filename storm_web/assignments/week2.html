            'Loud and clear,' though not referring to the typography and design choices of the Frog website, is apropos to the topic- the information is readable and clean, while not following the most minimal example of web design. I really liked the use of color and blocks here, as well as the way that text and imagery was combined. (I'm also a sans serif fan.) I think the information is ultimately displayed well and in a readable, aesthetically pleasing, and engaging fashion- a result of these variety of choices made.

          In stark contrast to my first example is LingsCars- which becomes animated on the web, so it’s worth checking out for the full effect! You only need the screenshot to see the clash of information and type is, the chaos of the many elements and their composition. To me, it's reminiscent of an internet pop-up, but a version that's terrifyingly taken over a full website. While this is assumedly a marketing move, because LingsCars is a real business, (and I can understand a kitsch appeal of the nineties web aesthetic), I wouldn't be motivated to lease a car from this company. Nor do I feel like I could easily distinguish much about LingsCars (I really haven’t, even after attempting to navigate the website.)
